    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Mr. Yadong is currently a Ph.D. candidate at University of Calgary with the 
      specialty in Geotechnical Engineering. He has 4+ yrs of experience in soil-
      pipeline interaction problems from both (full-scale) experimental and numerical 
      (FEM) perspectives. Besides, he is also familiar with soil lab testing, including
      Triaxial, Standard compaction, Oedometer, Suction measurement tests, etc..
      
      
education:
    - degree: Ph.D. in Geotechnical Engineering
      university: University of Calgary
      time: 2016.9 - present
      details: |
        As one of the main participants of the soil-pipeline interaction behavior under
        heavy truck load, Mr. Yadong successfully designed and conducted two full-scale
        tests on X52 steel pipes. His roles in this project are: 
          - Prepared sketches using AutoCAD along with specifications after designing the full-scale tests 
          - Supervised construction crews to guarantee the quality of soil compaction and subsequent loading tests
          - Designed and conducted two full-scale tests to investigate the impact of heavy truck load on the mechanical behavior of decommissioned pipes
          - Experimentally investigated the stress rise effect due to pipe corrosion
          - Developed Python programs to efficiently process the experimental data 
          - Developed 3D finite element models using ABAQUS to simulate soil-pipeline interaction problems considering material, geometric and contact nonlinearities
          - Designed a testing method and assembled the equipment to conduct oedometer and undrained triaxial tests on unsaturated sand and clay
    - degree: MSc in Geological Engineering
      university: Tongji University
      time: 2013.9 - 2016.4
      details: |
        During the 2yrs and half studying period at Tongji University, Mr. Yadong was mainly focusing on 
        experimental investigation of the permeability of supercritical CO2 through caprock.
          - Conducted permeability test of SC-CO2 through caprock under high pressure
          - Analysed data of hollow column tests on fiber reinforced sand and write a draft for publication
          - Experimentally studied the dynamic response of pavements on elastic foundation
